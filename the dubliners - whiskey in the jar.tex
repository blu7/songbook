\begin{verse}
As \G{}I was a goin' over the \Em{}far famed Kerry mountains\\
I \C{}met with captain Farrell and his \G{}money he was \Em{}counting\\
I \G{}first produced my pistol and I \Em{}then produced my rapier\\
Saying "\C{}Stand and deliver" for he \G{}were a bold de\Em{}ceiver\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Mush-a \D{}ring dum-a do dum-a da\\
\G{}Wack for the daddy'ol,\\
\C{}wack fall the daddy'ol\\
There's \x{(G}whiskey \x{D)}in the \G{}jar\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny\\
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny\\
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me\\
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber\\
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder\\
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water\\
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel\\
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell\\
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier\\
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Now there's some take delight in the carriages a rolling\\
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling\\
but I take delight in the juice of the barley\\
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army\\
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney\\
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny\\
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}
