\begin{verse}
\C{}Have you seen the \G{}old man, \Am{}in the closed-down \Em{}market\\
\F{}picking up the \C{}papers, with his \Ds{}worn-out \Gs{}shoes?\\
\C{}In his eyes you \G{}see no pride, \Am{}and held loosely \Em{}by his side\\
\F{}yesterday's \C{}papers, telling \Gs{}yesterday's \C{}news\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\C{}\qquad So \F{}how can you \Em{}tell me, you're \C{}lo - ne - \Am{}ly\\
\Ds{}\qquad  and say for \Ds{}you that the sun don't \G{}shine?\Gs{}\\
\C{}Let me take you \G{}by the hand, and \Am{}lead you through the \Em{}streets of London\\
\F{}\qquad  I'll show you \C{}something, to \Gs{}make you change your \C{}mind\C{}\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Have you seen the old gal, who walks the streets of London\\
dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?\\
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking\\
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And in the all-night cafe, at a quarter past eleven\\
some old man sitting there, all on his own\\
Looking at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup\\
Each day lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And have you seen the old man, outside the seaman's mission?\\
His memory's fading, with those medal ribbons that he wears\\
And in our winter city, the rain cries little pity\\
For one more forgotten hero, and a world that doesn't care\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
$Chorus$
\end{verse}
