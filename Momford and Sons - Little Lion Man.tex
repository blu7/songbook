\begin{verse}
\Am{}Weep for yourself, my man,
you'll never be what is in your \C{}heart.\\
\Am{}Weep little lion man,
you're not as brave as you were at the \C{}start.\\
\G{}Rate yourself and rape yourself,
\F{}take all the \Fmajs{}courage you have \C{}left.\\
\G{}Wasted on fixing all the
\F{}problems that you \Fmajs{}made in your own \C{}head.\\

\begin{verse}
But it was \Am{}not your \F{}fault but \C{}mine,\\
and it was \Am{}your heart \F{}on the \C{}line.\\
I really \Am{}fucked it \F{}up this \C{}time,\\
didn't I, my \G{}dear?\\
Didn't I, my dear?\Am{}\\
\end{verse}

Tremble for yourself my man,
you know that you have seen this all before.\\
Tremble little lion man,
you'll never settle any of your scores.\\
Your grace is wasted in your face,
your boldness stands alone among the wreck.\\
Learn from your mother or else
spend your days biting your own neck.\\

\begin{verse}
Chorus:
But it was not your fault but mine,\\
and it was your heart on the line.\\
I really fucked it up this time,\\
didn't I, my dear?\\
But it was not your fault but mine,\\
and it was your heart on the line.\\
I really fucked it up this time,\\
didn't I, my dear?\\
Didn't I, my dear?\\
