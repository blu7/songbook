\begin{verse}
On the  \Em{}first part of the \upchord{Dmaj9/6}journey\\
I was \Em{}looking at all the \upchord{Dmaj9/6}life\\
There were \Em{}plants and birds. and \upchord{Dmaj9/6}rocks and things\\
There was \Em{}sand and hills and \upchord{Dmaj9/6}rings\\
The \Em{}first thing I met, was a \upchord{Dmaj9/6}fly with a buzz\\
And the \Em{}sky, with no \upchord{Dmaj9/6}clouds\\
The \Em{}heat was hot, and the \upchord{Dmaj9/6}ground was dry\\
But the \Em{}air was full of \upchord{Dmaj9/6}sound\\


\begin{verse}
I've \upchord{Em9}been through the desert on a \upchord{Dmaj9}horse with no name\\
It felt \upchord{Em9}good to be out of the \upchord{Dmaj9}rain\\
In the \upchord{Em9}desert you can \upchord{Dmaj9}remember your name\\
'Cause there \upchord{Em9}ain't no one for to \upchord{Dmaj9}give you no pain\\

\upchord{Em9}laa la \upchord{Dmaj9}la lalala la la \upchord{Em9}la laa la\upchord{Dmaj9} \qquad $(2\times)$ \\
\end{verse}


After two days, in the desert sun\\
My skin began to turn red\\
After three days, in the desert fun\\
I was looking at a river bed\\
And the story it told, of a river that flowed\\
Made me sad to think it was dead\\

\begin{verse}
\textit{[chorus]}
\end{verse}


After nine days, I let the horse run free\\
'Cause the desert had turned to sea\\
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things\\
There was sand and hills and rings\\
The ocean is a desert, with it's life underground\\
And a perfect disguise above\\
Under the cities lies, a heart made of ground\\
But the humans will give no love\\
