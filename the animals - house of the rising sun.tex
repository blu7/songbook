They \Am{}call the \C{}Rising \E{}Sun,\Es{}\\

\begin{verse}
My mother was a tailor\\
She sewed my new bluejeans\\
My father was a gamblin' man\\
Down in New Orleans\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Now the only thing a gambler needs\\
Is a suitcase and trunk\\
And the only time he's satisfied\\
Is when he's on a drunk\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Oh mother tell your children\\
Not to do what I have done\\
Spend your lives in sin and misery\\
In the House of the Rising Sun\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Well, I got one foot on the platform\\
The other foot on the train\\
I'm goin' back to New Orleans\\
To wear that ball and chain\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Well, there is a house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy\\
And God I know I'm one\\

There is a house down in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl\\
And me, oh god, Im a-one\\

\begin{verse}
My mother was a tailor\\
She sewed these new blue jeans\\
My sweetheart was a gambler, lord\\
Down in New Orleans\\
\end{verse}

Now the only thing a gambler needs\\
Is a suitcase and a trunk\\
And the only time he's satisfied\\
Is when he's on a drunk\\

\begin{verse}
He fills his glasses up to the brim\\
And hell pass the cards around\\
And the only pleasure he gets out of life\\
Is ramblin from town to town\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Oh tell my baby sister\\
Not to do what I have done\\
But shun that house in New Orleans\\
They call the Rising Sun\\

Well, it's one foot on the platform\\
And the other foot on the train\\
Im goin back to New Orleans\\
To wear that ball and chain\\

My race is almost run\\
Im goin back to end my life\\
Down in the Rising Sun\\
