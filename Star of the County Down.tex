\begin{verse}
Near to \upchord{Em}Banbridge town, in the \upchord{G}County \upchord{D}Down, one \upchord{G}morning \upchord{Em}in July\upchord{D}\\
Down a \upchord{Em}boreen green came a \upchord{G}sweet coll\upchord{D}een and she \upchord{G}smiled as she \upchord{C}passed \upchord{D}me \upchord{Em}by\\
She \upchord{G}looked so neat from her \upchord{Am}two white feet to the \upchord{G}sheen of her \upchord{Em}nut-brown \upchord{D}hair\\
Sure the \upchord{Em}coaxing elf, I'd to \upchord{G}shake my\upchord{D}self, to make \upchord{Em}sure I was \upchord{C}stan\upchord{D}ding \upchord{Em}there\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{Chorus}\\
From \upchord{G}Bantry Bay up to \upchord{Am}Derry Quay and from \upchord{G}Galway to \upchord{Em}Dublin \upchord{D}town\\
No \upchord{Em}maid I've seen like the \upchord{G}sweet \upchord{D}colleen that I \upchord{Em}met in \upchord{C}Coun\upchord{D}ty \upchord{Em}Down\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
As she onward sped, sure I shook my head and I gazed with a feeling quare\\
And I said, says I to a passer-by, who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?\\
He smiled at me and with pride says he, that's the gem of Irelands crown\\
She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann, she's the star of the County Down \\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{Chorus}\\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town\\
No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen that I met in County Down\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
She'd a soft brown eye and a look so sly and a smile like the rose in June\\
And you held each note from her lily-white throat, as she lilted an Irish tune\\
At the pattern dance you were in trance as she tripped through a jig or reel\\
When her eyes she'd roll, she would lift soul as your heart she would likely steal\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{Chorus}\\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town\\
No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen that I met in County Down\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
At the harvest fair she'll be surely there and I'll dress my Sunday clothes\\
With my shoes shon bright and my hat cocked right for a smile from the nut-brown Rose\\
No pipe I smoke, no horse I'll yoke, let my plough with the rust turns brown\\
Till a smiling bride  by my own fireside sits the star of the County Down\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
\textit{Chorus}\\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and from Galway to Dublin town\\
No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen that I met in County Down\\
\end{verse}
