You \upchord{C}talk like Marlene \upchord{Em}Dietrich \\

\begin{verse}
You live in a fancy apartment\\
Of the Boulevard of St Michel\\
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records\\
And a friend of Sacha Distel\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You go to the embassy parties\\
Where you talk in Russian and Greek\\
And the young men who move in your circle\\
They hang on every word you speak, yes they do\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
But where do you go to my lovely\\
When you're alone in your bed\\
Tell me the thoughts that surround you\\
I want to look inside your head, yes I do\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I've seen all your qualifications\\
You got from the Sorbonne\\
And the painting you stole from Picasso\\
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When you go on your summer vacation\\
You go to Juan-les-Pines\\
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit\\
You get an even suntan, on your back and on your legs\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
When the snow falls you're found in St Moritz\\
With the others of the jet-set\\
And you sip your Napoleon Brandy\\
But you never get your lips wet\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
But where do you go to my lovely\\
When you're alone in your bed\\
(Won't you) Tell me the thoughts that surround you\\
I want to look inside your head, yes I do\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
You're in-between twenty an thirty -\\
A very desirable age\\
Your body's firm and inviting\\
But you live on a glittering state\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Your name is heard in high places\\
You know the Aga Khan\\
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas\\
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh (ahaha)\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
They say that when you get married\\
It'll be to a millionaire\\
But they don't realize where you came from\\
And I wonder if they really care, they give a damn\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Where do you go to my lovely\\
When you're alone in your bed\\
Tell me the thoughts that surround you\\
I want to look inside your head\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I remember the back streets of Naples\\
Two children begging in rags\\
Both touched with a burning ambition\\
To shake off their lowly brown tags, yes they try\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So look into my face Marie-Claire\\
And remember just who you are\\
Then go and forget me forever\\
But I know you still bear the scar, deep inside, yes you do\\
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I know where you go to my lovely\\
When you're alone in your bed\\
I know the thoughts that surround you\\
Cause I can look inside your head\\
\end{verse}
